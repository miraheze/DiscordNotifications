3.1.0

Feature:
* Added support for embedding images on image uploads.

Refactor:
* BREAKING CHANGE: Individual config variables for action types have been condensed into a single one: DiscordNotificationEnabledActions. This includes:
** DiscordNotificationNewUser
** DiscordNotificationBlockedUser
** DiscordNotificationUserGroupsChanged
** DiscordNotificationAddedArticle
** DiscordNotificationRemovedArticle
** DiscordNotificationUnremovedArticle
** DiscordNotificationMovedArticle
** DiscordNotificationEditedArticle
** DiscordNotificationProtectedArticle
** DiscordNotificationAfterImportPage
** DiscordNotificationModerationPending
** DiscordNotificationFileUpload
** DiscordNotificationFlow
* Added property type declarations.
* Added return types to hook functions.
* Moved ModerationPending and APIFlowAfterExecute to their own separate handlers.
* Deduplicated DiscordNotifier::getDiscordUserText() code.

Fix:
* Set DiscordNotificationShowSuppressed to false by default.
* DiscordNotifier::parseurl() no longer parses out unnecessary symbols, causing broken URLs.
* Skip notifying imports when no revisions were imported.
